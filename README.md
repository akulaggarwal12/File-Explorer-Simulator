# Aether - File Explorer Simulator

## 📌 About The Project
Aether is a visual, File Explorer Simulator built entirely in C/C++. Utilizing the Raylib library for rendering, this project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to navigate and interact with file directories. It simulates a virtual file system environment where users can click on folder icons to open them, view their contents, and track their current path in real-time.

## ✨ Features
* **Graphical Interface:** Built completely from scratch using Raylib.
* **Interactive Directories:** Clickable folder icons that dynamically update the view to show internal contents.
* **Path Tracking:** A live-updating address bar displaying the current directory path.
* **Custom Assets:** Custom icons and fonts mapped to backend file structures.
* **Pure C/C++ Backend:** Efficient file and directory handling using standard C++ libraries.

## 🛠️ Built With
* [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) - Core application logic and backend.
* [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - Rendering, window management, and input detection.
